# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the app branding to “Barrera Healthy Eats”, add subtle tiger-themed decorations, and provide an optional user-controlled soundtrack.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all user-visible “HealthyEats” branding text with “Barrera Healthy Eats”, including the HTML document title and header/footer text.
- Add at least two small tiger-themed decorative decals as non-intrusive UI accents (e.g., in header/hero), loaded from frontend static assets and compatible with light/dark mode.
- Add optional background music controls (play/pause plus mute or volume), defaulting to OFF, persisting the user’s preference locally, and loading audio from a frontend static asset.

**User-visible outcome:** The site appears as “Barrera Healthy Eats” throughout, includes subtle tiger decorations, and offers optional background music that users can toggle and have remembered after refresh.
